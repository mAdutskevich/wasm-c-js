## Simple example of porting 2 math functions from C to Wasm

#### Run the command below inside the folder to compile math.c to math.js and math.wasm

emcc math.c -o math.js -s EXPORT_ES6=1 -s MODULARIZE=1 -s EXPORT_NAME=loadMath -s EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS="['_add', '_substract']"

#### You should see two files generated by that command: math.js and math.wasm. The first is a JavaScript file containing the runtime support to load and execute it. The second is a WebAssembly file containing the compiled code.
